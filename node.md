# Running a Node

As a node operator for NoFilter, you play a crucial role in maintaining the decentralized network. By running a node, you contribute to the security, privacy, and functionality of the platform, ensuring that it remains free from centralized control and censorship.

## Your Role as a Node Operator

Running a node means that you’re responsible for managing encrypted data transmissions between users. While user data remains private between nodes with encryption that NoFilter cannot access, the final leg of communication to client devices is also encrypted but with a key that NoFilter controls. This allows for data to be monetized on behalf of the node, while ensuring that your own node-to-node communications remain entirely private.

## Biometric Verification and Abuse Prevention

To prevent abuse and ensure the integrity of the network, all node operators must undergo biometric verification. This step ensures that each individual can only operate a single node, thereby preventing the creation of multiple nodes by the same entity. This process is crucial for maintaining a fair and decentralized network.

## Rewards and Incentives

As a node operator, you can earn rewards based on your contributions to the network. This includes earning tokens, gaining access to premium features, and building a strong reputation within the community. For full details on how the rewards system works, please refer to the [Rewards](#section4) section.

## Data Integrity and Responsibility

We take the integrity and security of user data very seriously. All data routed through nodes is fingerprinted to ensure traceability. This means that if any data is found to have been shared or distributed in an unauthorized manner, it can be traced back to the responsible node.

**Consequences of Data Misuse:**

- **Immediate Termination:** Any node found to be sharing or misusing user data will face immediate termination from the network.
- **Loss of Rewards:** Misuse of data results in the forfeiture of all accumulated rewards, including tokens, tiered access, and community recognition.
- **Network Ban:** The operator of a terminated node may face a permanent ban from operating future nodes within the NoFilter network.

Operating a node is a privilege, and with it comes great responsibility. We trust our node operators to uphold the principles of privacy, security, and integrity that NoFilter stands for.

## Getting Started

If you’re ready to contribute to the future of decentralized communication, setting up a node is straightforward. Follow the guidelines in the [Roadmap](#section3) to get started.
