## Phase 1: Foundation
- **Q1 2025:** Initial concept and architecture design. We are currently in the early stages of planning and conceptualizing the platform. Your ideas and expertise could significantly shape the future of NoFilter.
- **Q2 2025:** Development of core messaging features, basic node setup, and integration of a decentralized forum. This forum will serve as a point of entry for users to discover groups, join discussions, and connect with others. It will also function as a basic social network, enabling users to create and follow threads, share content, and build communities.
- **Q3 2025:** Internal testing, security audits, and preliminary forum setup. We need security experts, testers, and early adopters to ensure the platform is robust and secure before wider testing.

## Phase 2: Expansion
- **Q4 2025:** Launch of public beta for early adopters, including the decentralized forum. With your help, we aim to launch a beta version of NoFilter for the community to test and provide feedback on both messaging and forum features.
- **Q1 2026:** Introduction of node rewards and incentives. Developers are needed to implement and refine the rewards system that will incentivize participation, both in messaging and forum hosting.
- **Q2 2026:** Expansion of the node network to increase geographic diversity. We’re looking for developers and network specialists to help us scale the NoFilter network globally, ensuring a distributed and resilient forum and messaging service.

## Phase 3: Community Building
- **Q3 2026:** Community-driven development, feature requests, and implementation of post caps. As NoFilter grows, we need passionate developers to contribute new features, improve the platform, and refine forum functionalities based on user feedback.
- **Q4 2026:** Public launch and marketing campaigns. Help us take NoFilter to the world by building the features that will make it the go-to platform for uncensored communication and decentralized forums.

## Phase 4: Future Vision
- **2027 and Beyond:** Continuous improvement, scaling, and potential new features based on community feedback. This includes evolving the forum into a fully-fledged social network, enhancing discoverability, user engagement, and content sharing capabilities. The journey doesn’t end here—this is just the beginning. Join us in continuously evolving NoFilter to meet the needs of a diverse and expanding user base.
