<center>**NoFilter Manifesto**</center>
==============

---

## **Introduction**

In today’s world, control over what you say and who you say it to is slipping through your fingers faster than a wet bar of soap in a shower. The powers that be are tightening their grip on information, censoring speech, and peeking into your private conversations. Enter **NoFilter**—the platform for those who believe in saying whatever the hell they want without Big Brother breathing down their neck.

## **Core Principles**

1. **Decentralization**: We’re not here to hold your hand or tell you what to do. NoFilter is built on decentralization—no puppet masters, no strings attached. You’re in charge of your own space.
2. **Freedom of Speech**: Say what you want, when you want. We’re not here to play content police. NoFilter is your soapbox, not a controlled environment where only the "right" opinions are allowed.
3. **Privacy (If You’re a Node, That Is)**: If you’re serious about privacy, run a node. As a node operator, your data is fully encrypted and remains private. For the rest of you just running the client—let’s be upfront: your data is encrypted, but NoFilter has the keys to access it for monetization. But hey, that’s the trade-off for not running your own node.
4. **Autonomy**: No one’s going to force you to do anything. Whether you’re just using the app or going full geek mode and running a node, you do you. Your data, your rules (as long as you’re a node).

## **Our Vision**

NoFilter isn’t just another app; it’s a middle finger to centralized control. We’re here to create a space where anyone can connect, speak, and organize without a bureaucratic nanny looking over their shoulder. We want to see a world where communication is truly free—where you can chat without worrying about who’s eavesdropping or censoring you.

The vision? It’s simple. We’re building a network that’s resilient, self-sustaining, and open to anyone who values freedom over comfort. Run a node, and you’re part of the backbone of NoFilter. Stick to being a client, and, well, enjoy the ride with your data safely encrypted but open to monetization.

## **Call to Action**

NoFilter isn’t just an app—it’s a rebellion. We’re calling on the techies, the privacy fanatics, and the free speech warriors to join us. Got the skills? Contribute to the code. Got opinions? Spread the word. Got nothing? Well, at least run a client.

Together, we can build a platform that flips the bird to control, surveillance, and censorship. Let’s make NoFilter the home for the loud, the proud, and the unapologetically free.
